Hi Effecters! Welcome to **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**). 

A blog format that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find our quick-start guide and documentation that will be your first step in your Effect journey. Enjoy!

## Overview of TWIE

Before we get into what happened in the last week in our Community, we would like to say a few words about TWIE. 

We’re happy to witness the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect, and we understand that it might not be that easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Our Discord server **reached 1850+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We’re approaching our very first **[Effect Days Conference](https://effect.website/events/effect-days)** in Vienna on February 23, 2024, and lots of new content is coming up.
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub.

So, we wanted to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

In this way, we want to help you stay on track with everything happening in the Effect Ecosystem and actively engage with our community.

So, let’s start!
